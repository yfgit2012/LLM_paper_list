## AgentRxiv 

Target: improve MATH-500 accuracy using reasoning and prompt engineering

Multiple agents (LLM) collaborating: 
- each agent writes PDF paper, and upload to an Rxiv
- each agent can learn from other agents' work
- finally generate one research result in a final paper

precise solver (low temperature) vs creative solver (high temperature) --> cosine similarity 
if not close enough, use 'meta reassessment prompt' to reconcile 

Hallucination and reward hacking? 

This paper also includes cost analysis
