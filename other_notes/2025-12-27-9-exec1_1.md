## 3 Reasons You're Stuck in Tactical Implementation Even After a Promotion

**Summary (in English):**  
The article discusses why executives, such as Vice Presidents or C-suite leaders, often find themselves stuck in day-to-day tactical tasks after promotion, despite expectations of strategic leadership. The author identifies three key reasons: (1) a lack of clear delineation between levels of value (implementation, unification, communication, and strategy), leading promoted executives to remain in lower-value roles; (2) flawed hiring processes where leaders fail to delegate effectively and grow alongside the company, resulting in stagnation; and (3) pigeonholing, where individuals’ expertise in tactical roles prevents them from transitioning to strategic leadership. The author emphasizes the need for mentorship, training, and systemic changes to enable executives to shift from operational tasks to higher-level strategic responsibilities.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Lack of Delineation in Value Levels:**  
  - Four levels of value exist in the marketplace: implementation (tactical tasks), unification (management), communication (strategic communication with stakeholders), and strategy (visionary leadership).  
  - Promoted executives often remain in lower-value roles due to unclear boundaries between these levels, leading to frustration and unmet expectations.  
- **Flawed Hiring and Delegation Practices:**  
  - Companies frequently hire leaders who fail to delegate effectively, remaining in the same role despite promotions.  
  - This creates layers of leadership that take over tactical tasks, perpetuating the cycle of leaders staying in operational roles.  
- **Pigeonholing:**  
  - Executives may be pigeonholed due to exceptional skills in tactical roles, preventing them from transitioning to strategic leadership.  
  - Without delegation or process-building, promoted individuals remain burdened with day-to-day tasks.  
- **Need for Strategic Growth:**  
  - The author advocates for mentorship, training, and systemic changes to help executives move from tactical implementation to strategic leadership.  
  - Emphasis on communication, process-building, and advocacy is critical to avoid stagnation and align with organizational growth.  

**Reference Documents and Links Mentioned:**  
- The article references a **video** (implied to be part of the author’s content) but does not provide specific URLs.  
- A **link** is mentioned for applying to the author’s mentorship program, though the exact URL is not included in the text.  

**Analysis:**  
The article thoroughly addresses the systemic issues in executive transitions, emphasizing the importance of clear role delineation, effective delegation, and overcoming skill-based stagnation. It highlights the disconnect between promotion and strategic responsibility, urging leaders to adopt proactive strategies for growth. The lack of specific links suggests the content is part of a broader platform or service, but the core message centers on organizational and personal development for executives.

**摘要（英文）：**  
本文讨论了为什么高管，如副总裁或C级领导，在晋升后常常陷入日常战术任务中，尽管人们期望他们承担战略领导职责。作者指出了三个关键原因：（1）缺乏对价值层级的清晰界定（实施、统一、沟通和战略），导致晋升后的高管仍停留在低价值角色中；（2）招聘流程存在缺陷，领导者未能有效授权并随公司共同成长，导致停滞；（3）“职业定位”现象，即个人在战术角色中的专长阻碍了其向战略领导的转型。作者强调需要导师指导、培训和系统性变革，以帮助高管从运营任务转向更高层次的战略责任。  

**关键点：**  
- **价值层级界定不足：**  
  - 市场中存在四个价值层级：实施（战术任务）、统一（管理）、沟通（与利益相关者的战略沟通）和战略（愿景领导）。  
  - 晋升后的高管因缺乏这些层级的明确界限，常停留在低价值角色中，导致挫败感和未满足的期望。  
- **招聘与授权实践存在缺陷：**  
  - 企业常招聘无法有效授权的领导者，导致他们在晋升后仍担任相同角色。  
  - 这种现象形成领导层的重复性任务，延续领导者滞留在运营角色的循环。  
- **职业定位（“ pigeonholing”）：**  
  - 高管可能因在战术角色中的卓越技能而被“职业定位”，阻碍其向战略领导转型。  
  - 缺乏授权或流程建设，晋升者仍需承担日常任务。  
- **战略成长的必要性：**  
  - 作者倡导通过导师指导、培训和系统性变革，帮助高管从战术实施转向战略领导。  
  - 强调沟通、流程建设与倡导的重要性，以避免停滞并契合组织发展。  

**参考文档和链接：**  
- 本文提及了一部**视频**（作者内容的一部分，但未提供具体链接）。  
- 提及了一个**链接**用于申请作者的导师计划，但未包含具体URL。  

**分析：**  
本文深入探讨了高管转型中的系统性问题，强调明确角色界定、有效授权和克服技能停滞的重要性。文章指出晋升与战略责任之间的脱节，呼吁领导者采取主动策略实现成长。缺乏具体链接表明内容属于更广泛平台或服务的一部分，但核心信息聚焦于高管的组织与个人发展。
