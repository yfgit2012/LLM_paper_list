## 3 Reasons You're Stuck in Tactical Implementation Even After a Promotion

**Summary:**  
The article discusses the common frustration experienced by executives (e.g., VPs, directors, C-suite) who, despite being promoted, find themselves trapped in tactical, day-to-day implementation tasks rather than engaging in high-level strategic leadership. The author identifies three key reasons for this issue: (1) a lack of clear delineation between the four levels of value in the workplace (implementation, unification, communication, and leadership), (2) flawed hiring processes where leaders fail to delegate effectively and remain in their old roles despite growth, and (3) "pigeonholing," where individuals are trapped in technical or operational roles due to their expertise and lack of opportunities to transition to strategic roles. The article concludes by offering mentorship and training to help executives shift from tactical execution to strategic leadership, emphasizing the importance of aligning personal growth with organizational development.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Frustration of Executives:** Promoted executives often find themselves stuck in tactical roles (e.g., managing teams, projects, or processes) instead of engaging in strategic leadership.  
- **Three Main Reasons for the Issue:**  
  1. **Lack of Delineation in Value Levels:** The workplace lacks clear definitions of four levels of value (implementation, unification, communication, leadership), leading to confusion about roles and expectations after promotion.  
  2. **Flawed Hiring Processes:** Leaders often fail to delegate effectively, remaining in their old roles even after promotion, which causes lower-level teams to take on more tactical responsibilities.  
  3. **Pigeonholing:** High-performing individuals are trapped in technical or operational roles due to their expertise, with no structured process to transition to strategic leadership.  
- **Impact of the Issue:** Executives feel unfulfilled and overwhelmed, as their promotions do not align with the expectations of strategic leadership, and they lack time or support to focus on higher-level responsibilities.  
- **Solution Offered:** The author provides mentorship and training to help executives move from tactical execution to strategic leadership, including tools for building processes, communication skills, and self-advocacy.  
- **Call to Action:** The article encourages readers to apply for mentorship to address career stagnation and achieve meaningful promotion in both title and opportunity.

**摘要：**  
本文讨论了高管（如副总裁、总监、首席执行官等）在晋升后仍陷入战术性、日常性执行任务而非参与高层战略领导时的常见挫败感。作者指出导致这一问题的三个主要原因：（1）工作场所中对四个价值层级（执行、整合、沟通和领导）缺乏明确区分；（2）招聘流程存在缺陷，领导者未能有效授权，即使晋升后仍停留在原有角色，导致低层团队承担更多战术性责任；（3）“ pigeonholing”（因专业技能被限制在技术或运营角色中），由于缺乏向战略角色过渡的结构化流程，高绩效个体被困在技术或运营岗位。文章最后提出通过导师指导和培训帮助高管从战术执行转向战略领导，强调个人成长与组织发展的协调重要性。  

**要点：**  
- **高管的挫败感：** 晋升后的高管常发现自己陷入战术角色（如管理团队、项目或流程），而非参与战略领导。  
- **问题的三个主要原因：**  
  1. **价值层级区分的缺失：** 工作场所缺乏对四个价值层级（执行、整合、沟通和领导）的明确定义，导致晋升后角色和期望出现混淆。  
  2. **招聘流程缺陷：** 领导者常未能有效授权，即使晋升后仍停留在原有角色，迫使低层团队承担更多战术性责任。  
  3. ** pigeonholing（专业技能限制）：** 高绩效个体因专业技能被限制在技术或运营角色中，缺乏向战略领导过渡的结构化流程。  
- **问题的影响：** 高管因晋升与战略领导期望不符而感到空虚和压力山大，缺乏时间和支持专注于更高层次的责任。  
- **解决方案：** 作者提供导师指导和培训，帮助高管从战术执行转向战略领导，包括构建流程、沟通技巧和自我游说的工具。  
- **行动呼吁：** 文章鼓励读者申请导师指导，解决职业停滞问题，实现职位和机会的实质性晋升。
