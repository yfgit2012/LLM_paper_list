## 3 Reasons You're Stuck in Tactical Implementation Even After a Promotion

**Analysis of Article on Executive Stuck in Tactical Roles**

The article discusses why executives often find themselves handling daily operations despite being promoted to higher strategic roles. It identifies three key reasons for this issue and suggests solutions.

1. **Lack of Delineation Between Levels of Value**
   - The marketplace has four levels: implementation (tactical tasks), unification (managing teams), communication (strategic leadership), and a higher level involving vision or strategy.
   - Promotions may not always move individuals to the next level, causing them to remain in tactical roles.

2. **Hiring Process Issues**
   - As companies grow, top leaders sometimes continue in their original roles instead of moving up, creating unclear role definitions.
   - This confusion leads lower-level employees to perceive executives as non-strategic.

3. **Pigeonholing Due to Expertise**
   - Executives may stay in tactical roles because they excel at their current tasks, making it difficult to delegate and move into higher strategic positions.

**Suggested Solutions:**
- Mentorship and training focusing on moving from tactical to strategic roles.
- Building processes, communication skills, and support systems to facilitate this transition.

The article emphasizes the importance of executives growing with their companies to avoid being pigeonholed and to advance strategically. It concludes by offering mentorship opportunities for those looking to transition into higher-level responsibilities.

**关于高管陷入战术角色的分析**

本文探讨了高管为何常常发现自己仍在处理日常运营工作，尽管他们已被晋升至更具战略性的职位。文章指出了导致这一问题的三个主要原因，并提出了相应的解决方案。

1. **价值层级划分不明确**
   - 市场可以分为四个层次：执行（战术任务）、统一（管理团队）、沟通（战略性领导）以及一个更高层次涉及愿景或策略。
   - 晋升并不总是意味着晋升到下一个更高的层级，导致个人仍然停留在战术角色中。

2. **招聘过程中的问题**
   - 随着公司的发展，顶层领导者有时会继续留在原来的角色，而不是晋升上去，从而造成角色定义模糊。
   - 这种混乱使得较低级别员工认为高管不具备战略性思维。

3. **因专业技能而陷入固定模式**
   - 由于在当前任务中表现出色，高管可能会留在战术角色中，这使得他们难以 delegate 工作并过渡到更高层次的战略职位。

**建议的解决方案：**
- 针对从战术角色向战略角色转变的指导和培训。
- 建立流程、沟通技巧和支持系统，以促进这种转型。

本文强调了高管与公司共同成长的重要性，以避免陷入固定模式，并实现战略性发展。文章最后为希望过渡到更高层次责任的个人提供了指导机会。
