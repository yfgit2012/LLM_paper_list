## I Spent 5 Years Analyzing Why Managers Don't Get Promoted to Directors

**Summary:**  
The article outlines five critical responsibilities that managers must master to be promoted to director roles, summarized by the acronym RAISE. These responsibilities include refining strategic vision, articulating excellence, influencing across teams, supporting future leaders, and educating with insight. The author, an executive coach, emphasizes that failure to demonstrate these skills—whether through capability, communication, or strategic thinking—is a common reason managers are overlooked for director positions. The article also highlights the importance of executive presence, business acumen, and leadership development, while encouraging readers to engage with the author’s coaching services for personalized guidance.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Refine Strategic Vision (R):** Directors must align their department’s goals with the company’s long-term strategic vision, considering both immediate and future business needs.  
- **Articulate Excellence (A):** Setting clear standards for team performance and ensuring alignment with strategic goals is crucial, as directors cannot micromanage their direct reports.  
- **Influence Across Teams (I):** Effective leadership requires influencing cross-functional teams without direct authority, ensuring collaboration and alignment toward shared objectives.  
- **Support Future Leaders (S):** Directors should empower their teams by delegating responsibilities, coaching, and creating systems to develop independent, capable leaders.  
- **Educate with Insight (E):** Moving beyond information sharing to provide deep, critical-thinking-based insights is essential for executive-level leadership and thought leadership.  
- **Common Barriers to Promotion:** Lack of strategic thinking, communication skills, or ability to demonstrate leadership potential often hinders managers from advancing to director roles.

**摘要：**  
文章概述了管理者必须掌握的五项关键职责，以晋升为总监职位，这些职责由首字母缩写词RAISE概括。这些职责包括精炼战略愿景、阐明卓越、跨团队影响、支持未来领导者以及以洞察力进行教育。作者是一位高管教练，强调未能展示这些技能（无论是在能力、沟通还是战略思维方面）是管理者常被忽视晋升为总监职位的常见原因。文章还强调了高管气质、商业敏锐度和领导力发展的重要性，并鼓励读者通过作者的辅导服务获取个性化指导。  

**要点：**  
- **精炼战略愿景（R）：** 总监必须将部门目标与公司的长期战略愿景对齐，同时考虑当前和未来的业务需求。  
- **阐明卓越（A）：** 为团队绩效设定明确标准并确保与战略目标一致至关重要，因为总监无法对下属进行微观管理。  
- **跨团队影响（I）：** 有效的领导需要在没有直接权力的情况下影响跨职能团队，确保协作并实现共同目标。  
- **支持未来领导者（S）：** 总监应通过授权、辅导和建立系统来赋能团队，培养独立且有能力的领导者。  
- **以洞察力进行教育（E）：** 超越信息共享，提供基于深度思考的洞察力，对高管级领导和思想领导至关重要。  
- **晋升障碍：** 缺乏战略思维、沟通能力或展示领导潜力的能力，常常阻碍管理者晋升为总监职位。
