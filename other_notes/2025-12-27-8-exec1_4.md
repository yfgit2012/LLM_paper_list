- **Influence Across Teams (I):** Directors must lead cross-functional teams and influence decisions without direct authority.
- **Support Future Leaders (S):** Directors should empower and develop future leaders, enabling them to take on more responsibilities independently.
- **Educate with Insight (E):** Directors must think critically, provide deep insights, and act as thought leaders rather than just sharing information.
