## I Spent 5 Years Analyzing Why Managers Don't Get Promoted to Directors

**Summary in English:**  
The article outlines the five critical responsibilities managers must master to be promoted to director, summarized by the acronym RAISE. These responsibilities include refining strategic vision, articulating excellence, influencing across teams, supporting future leaders, and educating with insight. The author, an executive coach, emphasizes that many managers fail to advance due to gaps in these skills or their inability to demonstrate potential. The article highlights the shift from operational management to strategic leadership, requiring fiscal responsibility, cross-functional collaboration, and fostering leadership in subordinates. It concludes by encouraging readers to seek coaching to develop these competencies.  

**Key Points:**  
- **Refine Strategic Vision (R):**  
  - Directors must shape and refine the organization’s strategic vision, setting long-term goals and aligning their department’s direction with the company’s future.  
  - This involves understanding business acumen, market dynamics, and fiscal responsibility to guide the team toward sustainable success.  

- **Articulate Excellence (A):**  
  - Directors must define and communicate clear standards for excellence to ensure teams meet strategic goals.  
  - This includes establishing minimum performance benchmarks and operational norms to drive quality and alignment with organizational objectives.  

- **Influence Across Teams (I):**  
  - Directors must lead cross-functional teams without direct authority, influencing decisions and collaborating with stakeholders to advance the strategic vision.  
  - This requires strong communication, adaptability, and the ability to operate with limited information.  

- **Support Future Leaders (S):**  
  - Directors must empower subordinates to take on greater responsibility, delegating decisions and fostering independent leadership.  
  - This involves creating systems for training and mentoring to reduce reliance on tactical oversight and prepare leaders for future roles.  

- **Educate with Insight (E):**  
  - Directors must transcend information-sharing by offering deep, critical insights grounded in expertise.  
  - This positions them as thought leaders, capable of driving transformation through strategic, well-reasoned perspectives rather than routine knowledge.
